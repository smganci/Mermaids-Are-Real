            <h2>About</h2>
            
             <p>This site was made as an assigment for a web development course.  The prompt for this assignment was to make a website about a mythical creature using HTML and CSS.  </p>
            <p>My site is inspired by a time--an embarrasingly recent time--that I truly believed mermaids were real due to a very convincing mockumentary that I thought was a documentary.</p>
