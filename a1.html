        <p id="intro">Merpeople (commonly known as mermaids or mermen) have long been considered mythical creatures.  There are in fact myths of these majestic aquatic beings in almost every ancient culture--even in cultures that have little contact with one another. <i><b> With 95% of the ocean unexplored, how can we be so sure that Mermaids are entirely fictional?</b></i> How did separate cultures come to the same conclusions? I implore you to use this site to educate yourself on the evidence, nay, proof, that mermaids and mermen are not only real, but are thriving in the modern world.</p>
